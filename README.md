Diagramo
========

An interactive graph viewer in the browser. It gives you the ability to visualise your software project using UML diagrams. After loading your diagram, you can interactively experiment around and visualise changes you have made to your project or are going to do in the near future.


History
-------

The project has been started for my personal use at work. When doing serious changes to the models of our Django applications, I found it helpful to discuss those changes in a visual form. That's why this project is and will be focused on visualising software project.
